** Overview

G[o]TD means:

1. A go-lang GTD tool
2. GO TO DO !!

It is a light-weight command line tool, which managers your todo list. However, gotd is more than a TODO tool like [[https://github.com/google/gtd-txt][google/gtd-txt]] or [[https://github.com/mattn/todo][mattn/todo]]. It supports:

- Event collection and time audit.
  + We know when a task is done and how long it takes.
  + Also, we can track every operation on this task.
  + Moreover, we know how much time we spent on the same task in this week or last month.
- Layout and interface like **org-mode** . But EMACS is not required.
- Search quickly by keywords, tags, priority, state, ...
- ~Daily|weekly|monthly~ task definition & report, like org-aganda
- Serverless, using ~sqlite~ database as backend
